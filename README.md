This repository contains scratch-work and results for the MEMEX QPR at the end of April, 2016. It's in a somewhat unfinished state, but should be pretty usable. Here's a general guide to structure:

### `data`
Data from various teams working on the project

### `jeff_results`
Jeff Borowitz's scratch code for generating a working classifier

### `notebooks/go_notebooks`
Peter Landwehr's assorted scratchwork on Giant Oak notebooks. As a rule, they can be considered to be of two types:
* moving data from a raw state to a merged, more-polished state.
* Training classifiers on polished data.

#### `notebooks/go_notebooks/helpers`
Some useful helper functions for scoring and organizing work


**NOTE** that much of the data has been stored using Git LFS. This has caused some weirdness with downloading. Before cloning, be sure to install Git LFS and cross your fingers.
